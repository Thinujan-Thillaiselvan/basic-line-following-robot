# basic-line-following-robot
A basic line following robot is an autonomous mobile robot designed to follow a visual line or path, usually marked on the floor with black tape on a white surface (or vice versa). It typically uses infrared (IR) sensors or light sensors to detect the contrast between the line and the background. The robotâ€™s control system processes the sensor data and adjusts the wheels or motors to keep the robot aligned with the line as it moves forward. Line following robots are commonly used in robotics education to teach concepts like sensor integration, feedback control, and programming. They are simple yet effective examples of real-world automation and robotics principles.
